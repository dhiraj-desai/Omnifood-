Build Responsive Website with HTML and CSS with Flexbox and CSS Grid

**Key Features**
Having created the website from scratch, I learned how to create and implement features that I'm likely to use in my future websites over and over again. Here are some of the key features and topics that I worked on:

.Hamburger menu that appears on tablet-sized screens and smaller
Smooth scrolling whenever any navigation (header and footer) are clicked
Subtle animations that trigger when a certain viewport rule is met (e.g. element is in viewport or element is not in viewport) using IntersectionObserver
Added cross-broswer support for certain CSS styles using prefixes (-webkit, -moz-, -o-, -ms-)
Tested website on different browsers & had to style the select input so that it appears the same on all(Not really) browsers/devices
Functional form ðŸ’Œ
Fully responsive thanks to media queries âœ¨
Utilized grid, flexbox and absolute positioning
